2.8.0

<p>This is a feature release for JForum. It includes the following improvements, amongst others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Registration can be restricted to particular email addresses or email addresses from particular domains, and then be auto-assigned to specific groups.</li>
<li>The authenticity of outgoing emails can now be verified via DKIM. </li>
<li>The registration pages and the password recovery pages are now mobile-friendly.</li>
<li>It's now possible to log in with the email address as well as username, as that is what users expect these days.</li>
<li>New default connection pool, potentially increasing performance with multiple concurrent users.</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes and small improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/wiki2/NewFeatures280/">this page</a> for a full list of what is new and changed.</p>

<p>Everyone should upgrade, which involves running a fairly simple database upgrade script. A Servlet 3.1 container, like Tomcat 8, running on Java 8 is now required.</p>
